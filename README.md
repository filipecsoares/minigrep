# Grep Rust Command Line Tool

This Rust application is a command line tool that mimics the classic grep command (globally search a regular expression and print). The purpose is to practice and apply Rust concepts related to file and command line input/output.

The project follows the guidelines outlined in the official [Rust Book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch12-00-an-io-project.html) for creating a simple I/O project.

## Features

- Searches a specified file for a given string;
- Utilizes terminal features for enhanced user experience;
- Reads environment variables to configure tool behavior;
- Prints error messages to stderr for effective user feedback;
