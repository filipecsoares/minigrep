To the one that I love, my journey has begun
When our eyes meet once more there will be peace
The taste of your lips, the warmth of your touch
Again, forever, two souls as one
Uh

Seems like forever that my eyes have been denied
Home, I'm dreaming of home
I've been twenty years away from all I ever knew
To return would make my dream come true

Seasons of sorrow have stolen all my years
I miss the rolling hills of Ithaca
I've been through battles and cried a sea of tears
But the tide is changing, and with it all my fears
Yeah, I will return

Seems like forever that my eyes have been denied
Home, I'm dreaming of home
I've been twenty years away from all I ever knew
To return would make my dream come true
